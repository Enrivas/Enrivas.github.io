<li> Week 4: This past Saturday was one of the best. We got in touch with the basic of Java script. And made some cool basic stuff with it. I've been trying to make time to learn some. But now I know the basics and can explore more into it. </li>

<li> Week 3: This past Saturday I learned the basic of html and how to make a personalized website. After the class and during the lunch break I enjoyed the talk that we had about college struggles. Jim, Hannah, and the others brought some interesting facts and ideas to this topic. I will use some of the information I got to my advantage.</li>
